          Progressive Web Apps combine the capabilities of native platforms
          with the reach of the web to create web experiences that are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Reliable</b> - Load instantly and never show the downasaur</li>
          <li><b>Fast</b> - Are buttery smooth</li>
          <li><b>Engaging</b> - Something this that the other thing, what?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This new level of of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a
          place on the users home screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          When launched from the users home screen, service workers enable
          a Progressive Web App to <b>load instantly</b>, regardless of the
          network state.
        </p>
        <p>
          A service worker is like a client-side proxy, written in JavaScript
          and puts you in control of the cache and how to respond to resource
          requests. By pre-caching key resources you can eliminate the
          dependancy on the network, ensuring an instant and reliable
          experience for your users.

        53% of users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to
        load! And once loaded, they expect them to be fast, no janky scrolling
        or slow to respond interfaces.

          Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on the users 
          <b>home screen</b>, without the need for an app store. They
          offer an <b>immersive full screen</b> experience with help from a
          web app manifest file and can even re-engage users with web
          <b>push notifications</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web App Manifest allows you to control how your app appears and
          how it's launched. You can specify icons for the home screen and
          splash screen which is shown while the app is loading. Which page
          is loaded when the app is launched, screen orientation, even
          whether to show the browser chrome or not.

          When a <a href="/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/">
          set of criteria</a> is met, Chrome will prompt the user to add
          the Progressive Web App to their home screen. When users see this add
          to home screen prompt, they know that the app meets a quality bar
          and is <b>worthy</b> of being added to their home screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verifying that your Progressive Web App meets previously required a
          great deal of manual testing. Thanks to the new 
          <a href="/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse project</a>, itâ€™s
          possible to automate checks for many of these properties. You can
          even integrate Lighthouse into continuous integration systems to
          catch regressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building a high-quality Progressive Web App has 
          <a href="/web/showcase/">incredible benefits</a>. A great
          experience can delight users and improve business outcomes. A
          bit of up-front planning, on-device testing, and iteration with
          Lighthouse can make it easier to realise them.
